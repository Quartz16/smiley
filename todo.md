## New Features:

    - palette icon button where you click -> you can choose from brushes 
    - Default brush
    - Add new brush (storing config basically)
    - Delete brush
    - Save brush (maybe?, would require a certain format)
    - Eraser brush
2. Draw color
    - Color chooser slider???
    - Add to config:
        - Eye color
        - Mouth color
        - Circle color

## Bugs to fix:
